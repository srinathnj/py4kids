Part I - TD Lee - A Brilliant Mind - 智慧之心

Amid fighting flames, you sought out physics' light,
In a foreign land, following Fermi, you rose to new height.
At thirty, universe's door you pushed open,
Suddenly, parity symmetry became broken.

烽火途中寻物理，
异国升造随费米，
三十推开宇宙门
惊现宇称不守恒。


Part II - TD Lee - A Compassionate Man - 慈善之人

Though high in status, homeland has her place in your heart,
To nurture thousands of young talents was your art.
In basic science, like a fish flourishes in stream,
A homebound passion fueled your lifelong dream.

位高不忘故土情，
精心栽培万后生，
基础科学水育鱼，
热血满腔赤子心。

Part III - TD Lee - A Beautiful Soul - 祟高之德

Saying goodbye to your dear family and friends at San Francisco Bay,
Flying across the Pacific Occean, your soul soars the Westward Way,
Dating again your lovely Bamboo Lover in the Milky Way,
Being together in the Cosmos, you live forever a New Day.

自然安息金山乡，
两岸行空太平洋。
竹君有约会银河，
宇宙同游往西方。
