## Prompt to Claude

```
Can you help with translating an streamlit app called "CSV Importer" in python into react.js app?

It should meet the following requirements:
(1) python backend with SQLite but expose  its FastAPI interface;
(2) add DDL generation feature, I can run it on SQLite manually 
(3) export data, either SQL script or data file can be bulk loaded into tables,
(4) react.js for frontend

Since I am relatively new to react.js web framework, please clearly explain
(1) how to setup the react.js project locally on Ubuntu
(2) how to create dependency, 
(3) how to run the app

```
