       "[\"Three Little pigs\\nOnce upon a time there was an old mother pig who had three little pigs and not enough food to feed\\nthem. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes.The\\nfirst little pig was very lazy. He didn't want to work at all and he built his house out of straw. The\\nsecond little pig worked a little bit harder but he was somewhat lazy too and he built his house out of\\nsticks. Then, they sang and danced and played together the rest of the day.The third little pig worked\\nhard all day and built his house with bricks. It was a sturdy house complete with a fine fireplace and\\nchimney. It looked like it could withstand the strongest winds.The next day, a wolf happened to pass\\nby the lane where the three little pigs lived; and he saw the straw house, and he smelled the pig\\ninside. He thought the pig would make a mighty fine meal and his mouth began to water.So he\\nknocked on the door and said:  Little pig! Little pig!\\nLet me in! Let me in!\\nBut the little pig saw the wolf's big paws through the keyhole, so he answered back:  No! No! No!\\nNot by the hairs on my chinny chin chin!\\nThen the wolf showed his teeth and said:  Then I'll huff\\nand I'll puff\\nand I'll blow your house down.\\nSo he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down! The wolf opened his jaws very wide and\\nbit down as hard as he could, but the first little pig escaped and ran away to hide with the second\\nlittle pig.The wolf continued down the lane and he passed by the second house made of sticks; and\\nhe saw the house, and he smelled the pigs inside, and his mouth began to water as he thought\\nabout the fine dinner they would make.So he knocked on the door and said:  Little pigs! Little pigs!\\nLet me in! Let me in!\\nBut the little pigs saw the wolf's pointy ears through the keyhole, so they answered back:  No! No!\\nNo!\\nNot by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!\\nSo the wolf showed his teeth and said:  Then I'll huff\\nand I'll puff\\nand I'll blow your house down!\\nSo he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down! The wolf was greedy and he tried to catch\\nboth pigs at once, but he was too greedy and got neither! His big jaws clamped down on nothing but\\nair and the two little pigs scrambled away as fast as their little hooves would carry them.The wolf\\nchased them down the lane and he almost caught them. But they made it to the brick house and\\nslammed the door closed before the wolf could catch them. The three little pigs they were very\\nfrightened, they knew the wolf wanted to eat them. And that was very, very true. The wolf hadn't\\neaten all day and he had worked up a large appetite chasing the pigs around and now he could\\nsmell all three of them inside and he knew that the three little pigs would make a lovely feast.So the\\nwolf knocked on the door and said:  Little pigs! Little pigs!\\nLet me in! Let me in!\\nBut the little pigs saw the wolf's narrow eyes through the keyhole, so they answered back:  No! No!\\nNo!\\nNot by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!\\nSo the wolf showed his teeth and said:  Then I'll huff\\nand I'll puff\\nand I'll blow your house down.\",\n",
       " \"Well! he huffed and he puffed. He puffed and he huffed. And he huffed, huffed, and he puffed,\\npuffed; but he could not blow the house down. At last, he was so out of breath that he couldn't huff\\nand he couldn't puff anymore. So he stopped to rest and thought a bit.But this was too much. The\\nwolf danced about with rage and swore he would come down the chimney and eat up the little pig for\\nhis supper. But while he was climbing on to the roof the little pig made up a blazing fire and put on a\\nbig pot full of water to boil. Then, just as the wolf was coming down the chimney, the little piggy\\npulled off the lid, and plop! in fell the wolf into the scalding water.So the little piggy put on the cover\\nagain, boiled the wolf up, and the three little pigs ate him for supper.\"]"
