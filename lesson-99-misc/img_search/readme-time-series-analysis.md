## Why time series?

Machine data

### DevOps, monitoring and observability

Collect CPU, memory and storage metrics from your infrastructure and get real-time visibility into your entire stack.

 

### Network traffic analysis

Collect sFlow or other network traffic metadata to run analytics and detect anomalies in real-time.

 

### Application metrics

Empower application developers and UX teams to track and visualize user behavior data, API calls, data latency, and other application events in real-time.

 

### Market data

Store market tick data to identify historical trends, find correlations and analyze trades in real-time. Build aggregated views across multiple venues and efficiently compute live order books.

 

### Connected IoT/auto devices

Capture, store and respond to sensor data and telemetry at any resolution in industrial or machine-to-machine applications.

 

### Machine learning with time-series data

Use QuestDB with popular Python frameworks and tools for leveraging anomaly detection algorithms, machine learning libraries, statistical analysis with Pandas, or Jupyter notebooks.
