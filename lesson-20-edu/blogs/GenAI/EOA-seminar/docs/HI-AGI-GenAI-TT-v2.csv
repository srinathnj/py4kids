Attribute,Human Intelligence (HI),Artificial General Intelligence (AGI),Generative AI,Turing Test (TT)
Definition,Natural intelligence demonstrated by humans,Hypothetical AI that matches or exceeds human intelligence across all domains,AI systems capable of creating new content based on patterns in training data,A test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from a human
Cognitive Abilities,"Read write listen speak plan reason problem-solve learn adapt","Potentially all human cognitive abilities, possibly superhuman abilities in some or all areas","Generate text images code, analyze and process data, limited contextual understanding, pattern recognition and application","Engage in open-ended conversation, demonstrate language understanding, show reasoning abilities"
Emotional & Social Intelligence,"Empathy emotional regulation social interaction relationship building care giving collaboration","Theoretical understanding and simulation of emotions, potential for advanced social interaction","Simulate emotional responses generate emotionally-toned content, no true emotional experience","Simulate emotional responses, engage in seemingly natural conversation"
Creativity,"Original ideas artistic expression innovation dreaming (both sleeping and aspirational)","Potential for novel idea generation, possible superhuman creative abilities","Combine and recombine existing ideas in novel ways, generate variations on themes, no true understanding of created content","Demonstrate creative language use, generate human-like creative responses"
Physical Abilities,"Motor skills sensory perception physical interaction with environment reproduction","Potential for advanced robotic integration, possible superhuman physical abilities through robotic bodies","No physical embodiment, can generate instructions or designs for physical tasks",Not applicable (text-based test)
Self-Awareness,"Consciousness self-reflection metacognition existential thinking","Debated philosophical question, potential for advanced self-awareness","No true self-awareness, can generate text about self-awareness",Ability to discuss self and experiences convincingly
Emotional Range,"Experience joy sadness anger fear complex emotions like nostalgia melancholy aspire and despair love and grieve","Theoretical potential to simulate full emotional range, philosophical questions about genuine emotion","Generate content expressing emotions, no genuine emotional experience",Simulate a range of emotional responses in conversation
Spiritual & Philosophical Aspects,"Capacity for faith and spirituality engage in prayer or meditation ponder existence and meaning develop and follow moral codes","Potential for understanding spiritual concepts, ability to reason about ethics and philosophy, question of machine consciousness","Generate content about spiritual or philosophical topics, no genuine spiritual experience or beliefs","Engage in discussions about spirituality and philosophy, cannot genuinely hold beliefs"
Social Bonding,"Form deep lasting relationships altruism and sacrifice for others intergenerational knowledge transfer cultural participation and creation","Potential for advanced social modeling, question of genuine connection vs simulation","Simulate social interactions generate content about relationships, no genuine social bonds","Simulate relationship-building in conversation, cannot form genuine bonds"
Limitations,"Cognitive biases physical limitations need for rest/sleep mortality","Unknown potential ethical concerns possible unforeseen consequences","Bounded by training data lack of true understanding no general intelligence potential for biased outputs","Limited to language-based interaction, may not test all aspects of intelligence"
Unique Human Traits,"Sense of humor appreciation of beauty experience of qualia intuition gut feelings serendipity",Uncertain if these can be truly replicated,"Can mimic but not genuinely experience, generate content related to these concepts",Potentially simulate these traits in conversation
Current Status,Exists,Theoretical/Not yet achieved,Exists and rapidly evolving,Exists as a concept debated effectiveness
