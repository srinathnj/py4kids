# Introduction to GenAI: Past > Present > Future
Date: 2024-11-16

## Opening
Welcome everyone to this seminar on Introduction to Generative AI. Today, we'll embark on a journey through the past, present, and future of GenAI, structured like Dorothy's journey in "The Wizard of Oz" - following the yellow brick road to discover the transformative power of this technology.

## Past - "The Storm Gathering"

### Slide 3: AI > ML > DL > GenAI
Let's start by understanding the hierarchy of artificial intelligence. GenAI is part of a larger family: AI encompasses all artificial intelligence, Machine Learning is a subset of AI, Deep Learning is a specialized form of ML, and Generative AI represents the latest evolution in this field.

### Slide 4: AI History
The journey to GenAI has been built on crucial technological milestones:
- 1984: Apple Mac introduced personal computing to the masses
- 1989: Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web at CERN
- 1998: Google Search transformed information access
- 2015: OpenAI's founding marked a new era in AI research
- 2018: The Turing Award recognized the deep learning pioneers
- 2022: ChatGPT's launch revolutionized public perception of AI

### Slide 5: The Turing Test
The Turing Test, proposed by Alan Turing, remains a fundamental benchmark for machine intelligence. It asks whether a machine can exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from a human - a concept now more relevant than ever with modern GenAI systems.

### Slides 8-11: How GenAI Works
Let's demystify the technology:
- LLMs are built through massive data training
- Neural networks learn patterns through layers of processing
- At its core, an LLM is a function (y = f(x)) that predicts the most likely next token
- Training involves optimizing billions of parameters

### Slide 12: LLM Explainability
Dr. Tomaso Poggio's work helps us understand three crucial aspects:
- Generalization Theory: How networks learn effectively despite parameter complexity
- Representation Learning: The development of hierarchical internal representations
- Optimization Dynamics: The effectiveness of gradient descent in complex spaces

## Present - "Following the Yellow Brick Road"

### Slides 14-15: State of AI 2024
The field has achieved remarkable recognition, including Nobel Prize contributions. The current state shows explosive growth in capabilities and applications.

### Slides 16-17: LLM Models and Players
We're seeing diverse model types and a competitive landscape with key players:
- Open source initiatives
- Commercial leaders
- Research institutions

### Slides 18-19: Open Source Platforms
- HuggingFace serves as a central hub for open-source AI
- Ollama enables local, private LLM deployment
  - Open: Run state-of-the-art models locally
  - Local: Simple setup on personal machines
  - Private: Data remains under your control

### Slides 22-24: Applications and Agents
Modern applications extend beyond simple chatbots:
- Intelligent agents can perform complex tasks
- Systems like CrewAI and AutoGen enable sophisticated workflows
- Mathematical and scientific applications show promising results

### Slides 25-37: GenAI Demonstrations
[Note: Here you would insert specific narration about each demo shown in your slides]

## Future - "Behind the Curtain"

### Slides 39-42: Geopolitics and Robotics
- The global AI race has significant geopolitical implications
- Integration of AI with robotics is creating new possibilities
- Privacy concerns become increasingly important

### Slides 43-46: Social Impact and AGI
- We must consider the broader social implications
- The path to AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) raises important questions
- AI evolution follows distinct stages toward greater capability

### Slides 47-49: Higher Intelligence and Human Nature
- The relationship between Human Intelligence, AGI, and GenAI
- Fundamental questions about what makes us human
- The importance of maintaining human values and ethics

## Closing
Like Dorothy's companions in Oz, we're seeking intelligence (Scarecrow), heart (Tin Man), and courage (Lion) in our AI systems. The real power, like Dorothy's ruby slippers, has been with humanity all along - it's about how we choose to use these tools.
