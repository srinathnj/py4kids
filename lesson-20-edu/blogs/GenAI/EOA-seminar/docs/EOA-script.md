# Introduction to GenAI: Past, Present, and Future
## Presentation Narration Script

### Opening
Welcome everyone. Today we'll explore the fascinating world of Generative AI through the metaphor of "The Wizard of Oz" - a journey of discovery, learning, and transformation.

### Past - "The Storm Gathering"

**Slide 3: AI > ML > DL > GenAI**
We'll start by understanding the hierarchy of AI technologies. Like nested Russian dolls, GenAI sits within Deep Learning, which is part of Machine Learning, which itself is a subset of Artificial Intelligence.

**Slide 4: AI History**
The timeline shows critical technological developments that laid the foundation for today's GenAI. From the 1984 Apple Mac to ChatGPT's launch in 2022, each milestone contributed to our current capabilities. Notable is the 2018 Turing Award to Hinton, LeCun, and Bengio for their groundbreaking work in deep learning.

**Slide 5: Turing Test**
The Chinese Room thought experiment raises fundamental questions about AI understanding versus simulation - a debate that remains relevant with today's LLMs.

**Slides 8-11: How LLMs Work**
At their core, LLMs are sophisticated pattern recognition systems. Think of them as mathematical functions (y = f(x)) that transform input text into output text through billions of learned parameters.

**Slide 12: LLM Explainability**
Dr. Tomaso Poggio's work helps us understand three crucial aspects:
- How networks learn despite parameter overabundance
- How they develop hierarchical representations
- Why gradient descent finds effective solutions

### Present - "Following the Yellow Brick Road"

**Slides 14-15: State of AI 2024**
The 2024 Nobel Prizes reflect the growing impact of AI in fundamental sciences. The current state of AI shows remarkable progress but also clear limitations.

**Slides 16-21: LLM Landscape**
We're seeing a diverse ecosystem of models:
- Commercial leaders like GPT-4
- Open-source alternatives on HuggingFace
- Local solutions like Ollama for private deployment
The benchmarks show continuous improvement in capabilities.

**Slides 22-24: Chatbots and Agents**
Moving beyond simple chatbots, AI agents represent more sophisticated systems capable of autonomous goal-directed behavior.

**Slides 25-37: Applications and Demos**
GenAI is making significant impacts across:
- Mathematical problem-solving
- Scientific research
- Automated discovery
[Live demonstrations of key capabilities]

**Slide 38: LLM Limitations**
It's crucial to understand current limitations:
- Hallucination and knowledge cutoff
- Context window constraints
- Lack of causal understanding
- Response inconsistency
- Overconfident responses (有问必答,不知闭嘴)

The capability spectrum shows we're still primarily in the statistical pattern matching phase.

### Future - "Behind the Curtain"

**Slides 40-44: Geopolitics and Robotics**
The AI race has geopolitical implications, especially in robotics and automation. Privacy concerns become increasingly important as AI systems become more integrated into daily life.

**Slides 45-47: Path to AGI**
The journey toward Artificial General Intelligence involves three stages, with current GenAI representing just the beginning.

**Slides 48-50: Higher Intelligence**
We conclude by examining what makes us uniquely human and how AI might complement rather than replace human intelligence.

### Closing
Like Dorothy's journey to Oz, our AI journey reveals that the "magic" lies in understanding both the capabilities and limitations of these technologies. The real power comes from knowing how to use them wisely.
