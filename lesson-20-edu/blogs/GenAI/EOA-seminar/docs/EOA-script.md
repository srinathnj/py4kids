# Introduction to GenAI: Past > Present > Future
## Presentation Narration Script

### Opening
Welcome everyone. Today we're going to explore the fascinating world of Generative AI through an unexpected lens - the story of "The Wizard of Oz." Just as Dorothy and her companions journeyed to the Emerald City, we're on our own journey through the landscape of AI, seeking understanding, capability, and wisdom.

### The Journey Framework
Like our friends from Oz, we're each on this AI journey:
- Dorothy represents us - already possessing the power to shape this technology
- The Scarecrow seeking a brain mirrors AI's quest for intelligence
- The Tin Man seeking a heart reflects our concerns about AI and emotion
- The Cowardly Lion seeking courage represents our need to boldly face AI challenges

### Past - "The Storm Gathering"
Let's start with where we've been - the gathering storm that brought us to this moment.

#### The Evolution (Slide 4)
We'll trace the path from broad AI concepts, through Machine Learning, into Deep Learning, and finally to today's Generative AI. Each step has built upon the previous, creating increasingly sophisticated systems.

#### Historical Context (Slide 5)
Our journey has key milestones:
- 1984: Apple Mac revolutionized personal computing
- 1989: The World Wide Web gave us global connectivity
- 2006: AWS Cloud enabled massive computational power
- 2015: OpenAI's founding marked a new era
- 2022: ChatGPT changed everything

#### The Turing Test (Slide 6)
We began with a simple question: Can machines think? Alan Turing gave us a framework to approach this question, setting the stage for everything that followed.

### Present - "Following the Yellow Brick Road"

#### State of 2024 (Slides 15-16)
We're in a remarkable moment, with AI achievements being recognized at the highest levels, including Nobel Prizes. The technology is advancing at an unprecedented pace.

#### Technology Landscape (Slides 17-19)
Today's AI ecosystem includes:
- Various LLM model types serving different needs
- A mix of commercial and open-source solutions
- Platforms like HuggingFace democratizing access
- Local solutions like Ollama enabling private deployment

#### Applications and Demonstrations (Slides 23-38)
We're seeing AI transform various fields:
- ChatBots revolutionizing customer service
- AI Agents handling complex tasks
- Mathematical problem-solving
- Scientific discovery automation
- Real-world applications in analytics (Text2SQL)

### Future - "Behind the Curtain"

#### Global Impact (Slides 40-44)
The future brings both opportunities and challenges:
- Geopolitical implications of AI leadership
- Integration with robotics
- Privacy concerns
- Broader social impact

#### Evolution and Understanding (Slides 45-50)
We're moving toward:
- The concept of AGI
- Three-stage evolution: Perception → Cognition → Decision Making
- Understanding what truly makes us human

### Closing Thoughts
Like Dorothy, we're discovering that the power to shape this technology has been with us all along. The key is understanding how to use it wisely and ethically.
