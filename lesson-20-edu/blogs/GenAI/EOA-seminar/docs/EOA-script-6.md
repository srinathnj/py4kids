# Opening: The AI Yellow Brick Road

### Opening Slide (with Wizard of Oz metaphor)
"Welcome everyone! Today we're going on a journey that might remind you of a familiar story - The Wizard of Oz. Like Dorothy's adventure, our AI journey has three distinct chapters:

1. The 'Storm Gathering' (Past)
   - Just as Dorothy's story began with a gathering storm
   - We'll see how the winds of technological change brought us to the AI revolution
   - From early computers to the whirlwind arrival of ChatGPT

2. 'Following the Yellow Brick Road' (Present)
   - Like Dorothy meeting her companions, we'll explore the various forms of AI
   - Each with their own unique capabilities and characteristics
   - From coding assistants to scientific discovery tools
   - Some might need courage, others brains, and yes, some even show heart!

3. 'Behind the Curtain' (Future)
   - Finally, like Dorothy discovering the truth behind the great Oz
   - We'll peek behind AI's curtain to see:
     * What's really possible
     * What's still magical thinking
     * How we can harness its power responsibly

Remember - just like Dorothy discovered, the real magic isn't in the technology itself, but in how we use it to enhance our own capabilities and achieve our goals."

### Transition to Technical Content
"Now, let's start our journey by understanding the basics, but don't worry - unlike the tornado that took Dorothy to Oz, we'll take a gentler path through the AI landscape..."


# Introduction to GenAI: A Journey to Oz
## Presentation Script for November 16, 2024

### Opening & Journey to Oz Setup
"Welcome everyone! Today we're embarking on a journey through the landscape of Generative AI, and I'd like to frame it through a story we all know - The Wizard of Oz. 

[Journey to Oz Slide]
Like Dorothy and her companions, we're all on a quest to understand and harness this powerful technology:
- Dorothy represents us all, discovering our innate power to guide this technology
- The Scarecrow seeking a brain mirrors AI's quest for intelligence
- The Tin Man seeking a heart reflects our concerns about AI's emotional intelligence
- The Cowardly Lion seeking courage represents our need to boldly face these technological changes

### Past - "The Storm Gathering"

[AI > ML > DL > GenAI]
"Just as Dorothy's journey began with a tornado, our AI journey started with fundamental concepts swirling together - Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and now Generative AI."

[AI History]
"Our yellow brick road has been paved with technological milestones: from the 1984 Mac to the WWW in 1989, through Windows, Linux, Google, cloud computing, and smartphones. Each step led us to the transformative moment of ChatGPT's arrival in 2022."

[Turing Test]
"Like the Wizard testing Dorothy and her friends, Alan Turing gave us a fundamental test for machine intelligence that still guides us today."

[AI Growth & Milestones through ChatGPT]
"The gathering storm of AI development has been building momentum, leading to breakthrough after breakthrough."

[How LLM Model is Built through Neural Network]
"Behind the curtain, these systems are built on neural networks - complex patterns of connections trained on vast amounts of data, much like how the brain learns from experience."

[LLM: y = f(x)]
"At its heart, like the Wizard's mechanisms, it's all about transformation - taking inputs and producing meaningful outputs through sophisticated functions."

[LLM Explainability]
"Professor Poggio helps us understand the magic behind the curtain through three key principles of how these systems learn and adapt."

### Present - "Following the Yellow Brick Road"

[2024 Nobel Prizes through State of AI]
"Our yellow brick road has led us to remarkable achievements, recognized even by the Nobel committee."

[LLM Model Types through Leading Players]
"Like Dorothy meeting different characters, each with unique abilities, we have different types of AI models serving various purposes."

[HuggingFace & Ollama]
"These platforms are like the Emerald City - places where anyone can access and harness AI's power."

[Model Leader Board & Benchmark]
"Just as the Wizard measured the worth of Dorothy's companions, we have ways to measure AI capabilities."

[ChatBot Use-Cases through Agents]
"AI assistants and agents are like helpful Munchkins, each specialized for different tasks."

[AI for Math/Sciences/SciAgents]
"In these fields, AI acts like the Good Witch, enhancing human capabilities rather than replacing them."

[GenAI Demos]
"Let's see this magic in action..." [Walk through selected demos]

[Text2SQL Demo]
"Here's my own contribution to the yellow brick road - transforming human language into database queries."

### Future - "Behind the Curtain"

[Geopolitics through Robotics]
"Like discovering the true nature of Oz, we must understand the reality behind AI's capabilities and limitations."

[Robot Workers & Privacy]
"As we integrate AI into our world, we must balance progress with privacy and human values."

[Social Impact]
"The workforce transformation ahead shows both challenges and opportunities: 375M jobs potentially displaced, but 300M new ones created - a net change we can manage with proper planning."

[AGI through HI]
"As we approach Artificial General Intelligence, like Dorothy's journey home, we must remember our true goal - enhancing human potential rather than replacing it."

[What Makes Us Human?]
"Just as Dorothy discovered her power was within her all along, we must recognize that AI's greatest value comes from augmenting our uniquely human capabilities."

### Closing
"Like Dorothy's adventure, our AI journey isn't about replacing human capabilities - it's about discovering our own power to use these tools wisely. The real magic isn't in the technology itself, but in how we choose to use it to make our world better.

Thank you for joining me on this yellow brick road through AI. What questions do you have about our continuing journey?"

# Empowerment Themes Through the Journey to Oz

### Opening Power Message
"Before we start our journey, notice how perfectly the Wizard of Oz mirrors our AI adventure:
- Dorothy didn't need external magic - she had the power all along
- Similarly, AI isn't about replacing human wisdom, but amplifying it
- Like Dorothy's companions, we each bring unique strengths to this journey"

### Past - "The Storm Gathering"
Reinforcement opportunities:

1. AI Family Tree (AI > ML > DL > GenAI)
"Like Dorothy meeting her companions one by one, let's meet each member of the AI family..."
