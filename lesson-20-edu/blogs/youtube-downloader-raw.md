what are the pros and cons for .webm and .mp4 video formats


Here's a concise comparison of .webm and .mp4 video formats:

Pros of .webm:

Better compression, resulting in smaller file sizes
Generally higher quality at lower bitrates
Supported by most modern web browsers
Cons of .webm:

Limited support on older devices and software
Not as widely compatible as .mp4
Can be slower to encode
Pros of .mp4:

Nearly universal compatibility
Supported by most devices and software
Good balance of quality and file size
Faster encoding times
Cons of .mp4:

Not open-source
Slightly larger file sizes compared to .webm at similar quality
May require licensing fees for commercial use in some cases
Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of these formats?

first time uses webm format video file, yes, it plays on my S22 android device,   I used pytube and yt-dlp tools to download YouTube videos, but pytube is not so reliable due to frequency changes in YouTube, what other tools one can use ?


I'm glad to hear the .webm format worked well on your S22 Android device. It's true that pytube can sometimes be unreliable due to frequent changes in YouTube's system. Here are some alternative tools you can consider for downloading YouTube videos:

youtube-dl:
A powerful command-line program to download videos from YouTube and other sites
Very reliable and frequently updated
yt-dlp (which you mentioned):
A youtube-dl fork with additional features and improvements
Often more up-to-date than youtube-dl
ClipGrab:
A free, user-friendly GUI application for downloading videos
Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
4K Video Downloader:
A user-friendly GUI application with support for various video sites
Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux
Has both free and paid versions
JDownloader:
An open-source download management tool
Supports multiple video sites, not just YouTube
VideoProc Converter:
A comprehensive video processing tool that includes YouTube download capabilities
Paid software with a free trial
VLC Media Player:
While primarily a media player, it can also download YouTube videos
Free and open-source
Remember that when using any of these tools, it's important to respect copyright laws and YouTube's terms of service. Some of these tools may require additional setup or have limitations in their free versions.

great that there are so many options, I used 4K Video Downloader before, nice GUI is good, but it is hard to automate, with pytube, I was able to do batch-download after preparing a list of URLs, let me evaluate others you mentioned, For personal use, I hope it is ok to download and avoid frequent interruption by annoying ads


I understand your perspective on using these tools for personal use and to avoid frequent ad interruptions. While I can't advise on the legality of downloading copyrighted content, I can provide some technical information about the tools that might suit your needs for automation and batch downloading:

youtube-dl and yt-dlp: These command-line tools are excellent for automation and batch downloading. You can create a text file with a list of URLs and use it as input for batch processing. For example:

Copy
yt-dlp -a url_list.txt
This command will download all videos listed in url_list.txt.
JDownloader: While it has a GUI, it also supports importing lists of URLs for batch downloading. You can copy a list of URLs to your clipboard, and JDownloader will automatically detect and add them to its download queue.
ClipGrab: It has a built-in batch download feature. You can add multiple URLs to the download queue through its interface.
VLC Media Player: While not as convenient for batch downloads, you can create a playlist of YouTube URLs and use VLC's "Convert/Save" feature to download them sequentially.
For your automation needs, youtube-dl or yt-dlp would likely be the most flexible options. They can be easily integrated into scripts for more complex automation tasks. If you're comfortable with command-line tools or scripting, these would be worth exploring further.

Would you like me to provide some basic examples of how to use youtube-dl or yt-dlp for batch downloading?

for youtube-dl and yt-dlp, please show me usage how to do batch downloading, with yt-dlp, it is has an option to extract mp3 audio, can youtube-dl do that? with yt-dlp, if I like to save as mp4 (not webm default format), how to do that, Thanks


Certainly! I'll show you how to use both youtube-dl and yt-dlp for batch downloading, extracting audio, and saving videos as MP4 files.

For both tools, first create a text file (e.g., urls.txt) containing YouTube URLs, one per line.

youtube-dl:
Batch downloading:


Copy
youtube-dl -a urls.txt
Extracting audio (MP3):


Copy
youtube-dl -x --audio-format mp3 -a urls.txt
Downloading as MP4:


Copy
youtube-dl -f 'bestvideo[ext=mp4]+bestaudio[ext=m4a]/mp4' -a urls.txt
yt-dlp:
Batch downloading:


Copy
yt-dlp -a urls.txt
Extracting audio (MP3):


Copy
yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 -a urls.txt
Downloading as MP4:


Copy
yt-dlp -f 'bv*[ext=mp4]+ba[ext=m4a]/b[ext=mp4] / bv*+ba/b' -a urls.txt
Key points:

Both tools can extract audio and download as MP4.
yt-dlp generally has more up-to-date format selection options.
The -a urls.txt option specifies the file containing the list of URLs.
For MP4 downloads, the format selection ensures you get the best quality MP4 video with audio.
Additional tips:

Add -o '%(title)s.%(ext)s' to customize the output filename format.
Use --yes-playlist if you want to download full playlists when a playlist URL is encountered.
Would you like me to explain any of these commands in more detail or provide information on additional options?

2 questions: 1) can one add comments in the urls.txt file? 2) will it skip downloading if a video was previously downloaded


Great questions! Let me address both of them:

Adding comments in the urls.txt file:
Yes, you can add comments in the urls.txt file. Both youtube-dl and yt-dlp support this feature. Here's how:

Lines starting with '#' are treated as comments and ignored.
You can also add comments after the URL on the same line.
Example urls.txt:


Copy
# This is a comment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID2  # This is also a comment
# Another comment line
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID3
Skipping previously downloaded videos:
Both youtube-dl and yt-dlp have options to skip downloading videos that have already been downloaded. Here's how to use them:

For youtube-dl:


Copy
youtube-dl --download-archive downloaded.txt -a urls.txt
For yt-dlp:


Copy
yt-dlp --download-archive downloaded.txt -a urls.txt
How this works:

The --download-archive downloaded.txt option creates and maintains a record of downloaded videos in the file downloaded.txt.
When you run the command, it checks this file and skips any videos that are already listed in it.
New downloads are added to the archive file automatically.
This approach is particularly useful for maintaining an up-to-date archive of a channel or playlist, as it will only download new videos each time you run the command.

Additional tip:
If you want to check for existing files in the current directory without maintaining an archive file, you can use the -c or --continue option. This will skip files that have already been fully downloaded in the current directory.
