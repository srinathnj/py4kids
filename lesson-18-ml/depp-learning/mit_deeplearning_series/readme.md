Lex Fridman

Lecture on most recent research and developments in deep learning, and hopes for 2020. This is not intended to be a list of SOTA benchmark results, but rather a set of highlights of machine learning and AI innovations and progress in academia, industry, and society in general. This lecture is part of the MIT Deep Learning Lecture Series.
