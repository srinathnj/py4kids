https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10302873/python-pyglet-avbin-how-to-install-avbin

How to fix it on Windows10:

1) Download 32bits AVbin.dll from AVbin Downloads
Please note: The 64bits AVbin dll does NOT work even you're using 64bits Win10.
So please download the 32bits instead.
2) The .exe from 1. extracts the avbin.dll into windows/system32/ folder.
Please cut/copy it and paste to windows/system/ folder. It looks windows10 refers to only 32bits AVbin but not 64bits.
You're good to go. Try it !
