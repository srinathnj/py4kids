We’ll show how you can use popular open-source libraries and tools including DuckDB, Gensim, Metaflow, and Keras to build a fully working cloud endpoint that serves predictions in real time, starting from raw data. We’ll be using the Metaflow sandboxes so you can easily code along (think Colab but for MLOps)!
