Ask questions to your company data in natural language. PandasAI empowers decision-makers with instant, data-driven insights, enhancing productivity and informed decision-making.

PandasAI uses a generative AI model to understand and interpret natural language queries and translate them into python code and SQL queries. It then uses the code to interact with the data and return the results to the user.
