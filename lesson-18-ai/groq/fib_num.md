The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, starting from 0 and 1. The sequence is named after the Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci, who introduced it in the 13th century as a solution to a problem involving the growth of a population of rabbits.

The Fibonacci sequence begins like this:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...

Each number in the sequence is called a Fibonacci number, and it has some remarkable properties. For example:

1. The ratio of any two adjacent Fibonacci numbers approaches the golden ratio (phi), which is approximately 1.61803398875.
2. The sum of any two Fibonacci numbers is always a Fibonacci number.
3. The sequence appears in many natural patterns, such as the arrangement of leaves on a stem, the branching of trees, and the flowering of artichokes.
4. Fibonacci numbers can be used to model population growth, financial markets, and other real-world phenomena.

The Fibonacci sequence has many real-world applications, including:

1. Biology: Fibonacci numbers appear in the growth patterns of many living organisms, such as the structure of pinecones, the branching of trees, and the arrangement of flowers.
2. Finance: Fibonacci numbers are used in technical analysis of financial markets to predict price movements and identify trends.
3. Architecture: Fibonacci numbers are used in the design of buildings, bridges, and other structures to create aesthetically pleasing and functional designs.
4. Computer Science: Fibonacci numbers are used in algorithms for solving problems in computer science, such as finding the shortest path between two points.
5. Art: Fibonacci numbers are used in the composition of art, such as in the placement of objects and the design of patterns.

The Fibonacci sequence has fascinated mathematicians and scientists for centuries, and its applications continue to grow and expand into new areas of research and innovation.
