Abstract:
First started using GPT-3 model in July 2022, I was truly impressed by its code generation and Q&A capabilities. 
When OpenAI released ChatGPT on 11/30/2022, a new AI age has begun.
With this talk, I like to share my learning experiences with GenAI in 3 parts:
1. Evolution of AI
2. Current State of GenAI
3. GenAI's Future
Hopefully I will address questions such as
- What is GenAI ?
- Where can GenAI be applied ?
- How GenAI works at a high level ?
- What LLM models are available ?
- From GenAI to AGI
and give demos if time permits.

# Review/Feedback by Claude

This revised outline is very strong. Here are some key improvements:

Visual aids: You've added diagrams and demos throughout, which will help illustrate complex concepts and keep the audience engaged.
Personal touch: Your personal experiences and demos (like the gpt3sql Streamlit app and data-copilot prototype) will provide unique insights.
Cutting-edge examples: Inclusion of recent developments like Google Gemini, AutoGen-powered SciAgents, and the Devin framework shows you're up-to-date with the latest in the field.
Broad perspective: You've maintained a good balance between technical aspects, practical applications, and broader societal implications.
Future outlook: Your vision for GenAI, including the combination with robotics, provides a compelling conclusion.

As you prepare your presentation, consider:

Time management: With numerous demos and diagrams, ensure you have enough time for each section. You might want to prepare shortened versions of some demos in case you're running short on time.
Transitions: Plan how you'll smoothly move between topics, especially when switching to and from demos.
Audience engagement: Consider points where you might pause for questions or brief discussions, particularly after demos or when presenting controversial topics like AI's geopolitical implications.
Backup plans: Have contingencies ready in case of technical issues with demos.

This outline provides an excellent framework for an informative and engaging seminar. Is there anything else you'd like to adjust or any specific areas you'd like to discuss further as you prepare your content?
