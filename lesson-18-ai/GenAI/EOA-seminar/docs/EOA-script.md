# Introduction to GenAI: From Past to Future
## Opening

"Hello everyone! Today we're going to explore one of the most transformative technologies of our time - Generative AI. Think of this presentation as our journey through the land of AI - much like Dorothy's adventure in the Wizard of Oz. We'll see where we've been, where we are, and where we might be heading.

## Past Section

[Slide: AI > ML > DL > GenAI]
"Let's start with a quick overview. Think of AI as a family tree. Artificial Intelligence is the grandparent, Machine Learning is the parent, Deep Learning is the child, and Generative AI is the newest member of the family. Each generation brought new capabilities and possibilities."

[Slide: AI History]
"AI's story is fascinating. It started in the 1950s with a simple question: 'Can machines think?' What began as rule-based systems evolved into something far more sophisticated through decades of research, breakthroughs, and yes, several 'AI winters' where progress seemed to stall."

[Slide: AI Growth & Milestones]
"But look at where we are now! The exponential growth in computing power, data availability, and algorithmic improvements has led to achievements that seemed impossible just a decade ago."

[Slide: OpenAI: ChatGPT]
"ChatGPT's release in late 2022 was a watershed moment. Suddenly, AI wasn't just a tech industry topic - it became dinner table conversation. But how does it actually work?"

[Slides: How GenAI Works, Neural Network, LLM: y = f(x)]
"At its core, GenAI is like a massive pattern recognition system. Imagine teaching a child language - they learn by seeing millions of examples. Similarly, these models learn from vast amounts of text, code, and data. The neural networks are like digital brain cells, working together to understand and generate content."

[Slide: 2024 Nobel Prizes]
"The scientific community has recognized the profound impact of these technologies. The breakthroughs that enabled modern AI have been acknowledged at the highest levels of scientific achievement."

## Present Section

[Slide: State of AI - 2024]
"Where are we now? We're in what I call the 'exploration phase.' Companies, researchers, and enthusiasts are discovering new applications almost daily."

[Slides: Model Types, Leading Players, HuggingFace]
"The AI landscape is diverse. We have different types of models optimized for different tasks. While big tech companies lead many developments, the open-source community through platforms like HuggingFace is democratizing access to these technologies."

[Slides: Agent Concept & Systems]
"One of the most exciting developments is AI agents - systems that can plan, reason, and execute tasks with increasing autonomy. Think of them as digital assistants that can handle complex workflows."

[Slides: AI for Math, Sciences, SciAgents]
"The applications are remarkable. In mathematics, AI is helping prove theorems. In sciences, it's accelerating discovery. These aren't just tools - they're research partners."

[Examples Slides]
"Let me share some concrete examples of how GenAI is being used today... [specific examples]"

[Text2SQL Project Slide]
"Here's a project I've worked on personally - converting natural language to SQL queries. It shows both the potential and current limitations of these systems."

## Future Section

[Geopolitics Slide]
"The development of AI has become a matter of national strategic importance. Different regions are taking different approaches to development and regulation."

[Robotics & Workers Slides]
"As AI meets robotics, we're seeing new possibilities - and new challenges. Job displacement is a real concern, but history shows that new technologies often create new types of jobs."

[Privacy & AGI Slides]
"The questions we face are profound. What happens to privacy in an AI-powered world? What does it mean when machines approach human-level reasoning?"

[HI-AGI-GenAI Slides]
"But perhaps the most exciting possibility is how AI might help us augment and evolve human intelligence itself. Could we achieve higher forms of intelligence through this partnership?"

[Maslow's Hierarchy]
"As we consider these possibilities, we must remember what makes us human - our needs, desires, and potential for growth haven't changed."

## Closing

[Journey to the Unknown]
"Like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz, we're on a journey into the unknown. AI might seem like a powerful storm transforming our landscape, but remember - behind every AI system are human creators, human values, and human choices. The technology is powerful, yes, but like the Wizard behind the curtain, once understood, it becomes a tool we can use wisely.

Thank you for joining me on this journey. Questions?"
