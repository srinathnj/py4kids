"Here's where we stand today - multiple companies, open-source projects, and research institutions pushing boundaries in different directions."

[Slide 16: LLM Model Types]
"Different models serve different purposes - from specialized task-specific models to general-purpose assistants."

[Slide 17: GenAI Leading Players]
"While big tech companies lead in resources, numerous players contribute unique innovations to the field."

[Slide 18: HuggingFace]
"HuggingFace has become the GitHub of AI - a central hub where developers share and collaborate on models."

[Slide 19: Ollama]
"Ollama represents a significant trend: bringing powerful AI capabilities to local machines, ensuring privacy and control."

[Slides 20-21: Model Leader Board & Benchmark]
"These benchmarks show how different models compare - but remember, raw scores don't tell the whole story of usefulness."

[Slide 22: GenAI Use-Cases]
"The applications span every industry - from creative tasks to scientific research, business operations to personal assistance."

[Slides 23-24: Agent Concept & Complex AI Systems]
"AI agents represent the next evolution - systems that can plan and execute complex tasks autonomously, like CrewAI and AutoGen demonstrate."

[Slides 25-27: AI for Math/Sciences/SciAgents]
"In scientific domains, AI isn't replacing researchers - it's augmenting their capabilities, accelerating discovery, and suggesting new approaches."

[Slides 28-36: GenAI Examples]
"Let's look at concrete examples of these capabilities..." [Detail specific examples shown in each slide, including the Selection Sort comparison]

[Slide 37: Self Service Analytics]
"Here's my own contribution - a Text2SQL system that transforms natural language queries into database operations, democratizing data access."

### Future - "Behind the Curtain"

[Slide 39: Geopolitics]
"AI development has become a global race, with different regions bringing unique strengths and approaches."

[Slides 40-42: AI + Robotics/Robot Workers/Privacy]
"The integration of AI with robotics brings both opportunities and challenges, particularly around workforce evolution and privacy concerns."

[Slide 43: Social Impact]
"Let's look at the workforce impact objectively: while 375 million jobs may be displaced, 300 million new positions will emerge. The net change of 75 million represents about 2.2% of the workforce - significant but manageable with proper planning."

[Slides 44-45: AGI & Path to AGI]
"As we approach Artificial General Intelligence, the key question isn't just about capability - it's about ensuring beneficial development."

[Slides 46-47: HI – AGI – GenAI - TT]
"The relationship between human and artificial intelligence is evolving. We're not just creating tools; we're potentially expanding the boundaries of intelligence itself."

[Slide 48: What Makes Us Human?]
"This brings us to perhaps the most important question: what truly distinguishes human intelligence and creativity?"

[Slide 49: Journey to the Unknown]
"We're on an unprecedented journey. Like any powerful tool, AI's impact will depend on how we choose to use and develop it."

### Closing
"Thank you for joining this exploration. I'm eager to hear your thoughts and questions about where this journey might lead us."

## Q&A
"I'd love to hear your thoughts and questions. What aspects of this AI journey intrigue or concern you most?"

OPENING:
"Hello everyone! Welcome to this journey through the landscape of Generative AI on November 16th, 2024. Like Dorothy's adventure in the Wizard of Oz, we'll experience the gathering storm of AI development, follow our own yellow brick road through current applications, and peek behind the curtain at future possibilities."

PAST - "The Storm Gathering" (Slides 3-12):
"Think of AI as an evolving family tree. Artificial Intelligence is the grandparent, Machine Learning the parent, Deep Learning the child, and Generative AI our newest family member.

The digital revolution unfolded through key milestones: the Mac in 1984 democratizing computing, the World Wide Web in 1989 connecting us globally, Windows and Linux making software accessible, Google transforming information access, and cloud computing and smartphones changing how we interact with technology. This path led to OpenAI's founding in 2015, the recognition of deep learning pioneers with the 2018 Turing Award, and ultimately, ChatGPT's release in late 2022.

At its core, GenAI works through sophisticated neural networks, trained on vast amounts of data. MIT's Tomaso Poggio helps us understand this through three key concepts: Generalization Theory explains their learning capability, Representation Learning shows how they develop internal structures, and Optimization Dynamics reveals why they find good solutions in complex spaces."

PRESENT - "Following the Yellow Brick Road" (Slides 14-37):
"The scientific impact of AI is being recognized at the highest levels, as we see in the 2024 Nobel Prizes. The AI landscape is diverse, with different models optimized for different tasks. While major tech companies lead development, open-source platforms like HuggingFace and Ollama are democratizing access.

One of the most exciting developments is AI agents - systems that can plan and execute complex tasks. Platforms like CrewAI, AutoGen, and AgentGPT are making these capabilities accessible to developers. In scientific domains, AI is becoming a valuable research partner, accelerating discovery and augmenting human capabilities.

Let me demonstrate this with some concrete examples... [GenAI Examples slides]

Here's a practical example from my own work - converting natural language to SQL queries, which you can see in action in the linked demo video."

FUTURE - "Behind the Curtain" (Slides 39-49):
"As we peek behind the curtain, we see both opportunities and challenges in the global AI landscape. The integration of AI with robotics raises important questions about the future of work and privacy. Our analysis shows potential displacement of 375 million jobs, but also the creation of 300 million new positions, with a net change that's manageable within normal workforce evolution.

As we approach the possibility of Artificial General Intelligence, we must consider what it means for human potential. Could we achieve higher forms of intelligence through this partnership? Perhaps the most important question isn't about artificial intelligence at all - it's about understanding what makes us uniquely human.

Like Dorothy in Oz, we're on a journey into the unknown. AI might seem like a powerful storm transforming our landscape, but remember - behind every AI system are human creators, human values, and human choices. Once understood, it becomes a tool we can use wisely for the benefit of humanity."
