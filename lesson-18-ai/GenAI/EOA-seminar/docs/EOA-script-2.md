# Introduction to GenAI: From Past to Future
## Opening

"Hello everyone! Welcome to this journey through the landscape of Generative AI on November 16th, 2024. Like Dorothy's adventure in the Wizard of Oz, we'll experience the gathering storm of AI development, follow our own yellow brick road through current applications, and peek behind the curtain at future possibilities.

## Past Section - The 'Storm Gathering'

[Slide: AI Concept]
"Let's begin by understanding not just what GenAI is, but why it represents such a transformative moment in technology."

[Slide: AI > ML > DL > GenAI]
"Think of AI as an evolving family tree. Artificial Intelligence is the grandparent, Machine Learning the parent, Deep Learning the child, and Generative AI our newest family member. Each generation has brought new capabilities and insights."

[Slide: AI History]
"The AI journey began in the 1950s with a simple yet profound question: 'Can machines think?' Through decades of research, breakthroughs, and yes, several 'AI winters,' we've arrived at a remarkable moment."

[Slide: AI Growth & Milestones]
"The exponential growth in computing power, data availability, and algorithmic improvements has led us to achievements that seemed impossible just years ago."

[Slide: OpenAI: ChatGPT]
"ChatGPT's release marked a watershed moment when AI moved from tech conferences to dinner table conversations. But how does it actually work?"

[Slides: How GenAI works, Learning: Neural Network, LLM: y = f(x)]
"At its core, GenAI works like a sophisticated pattern recognition system, processing information through layers of neural networks, much like our own brains process information."

[Slide: LLM Explainability]
"To understand why these systems work so effectively, let's look at three key theoretical foundations, brilliantly explained by MIT's Tomaso Poggio: First, Generalization Theory explains how these networks learn despite having more parameters than training examples. Second, Representation Learning shows how they develop internal structures similar to biological brains. And finally, Optimization Dynamics helps us understand why these systems consistently find good solutions in incredibly complex spaces."

## Present Section - "Following the Yellow Brick Road"

[Slide: 2024 Nobel Prizes]
"The scientific impact of these technologies has been recognized at the highest levels, with groundbreaking AI research being acknowledged by the Nobel committee."

[State of AI - 2024]
"We're now in what I call the 'exploration phase,' where new applications and capabilities emerge almost daily."

[Model Types through Benchmark Slides]
"The AI landscape is diverse, with different models optimized for different tasks. While major tech companies lead development, open-source platforms like HuggingFace are democratizing access."

[GenAI Use-Cases through Examples]
"From creative arts to scientific research, GenAI is transforming how we work. Let me show you some concrete examples..."

[Self Service Analytics: Text2SQL]
"Here's something close to home - a project I've worked on that converts natural language to SQL queries. You can check out the demo video at the link shown."

## Future Section - "Behind the Curtain"

[Geopolitics through Robot Workers]
"As we peek behind the curtain, we see both opportunities and challenges. AI development has become a matter of national importance, while robotics and automation raise important questions about the future of work."

[Privacy through AGI Slides]
"What happens to privacy in an AI-powered world? And what does it mean when we talk about Artificial General Intelligence?"

[HI – AGI – GenAI Slides]
"Perhaps most intriguingly, could we achieve higher forms of intelligence through the partnership of human and artificial intelligence? This isn't just about smarter machines - it's about augmenting human capabilities."

[What Makes Us Human?]
"As we stand at this technological frontier, perhaps the most important question isn't about artificial intelligence at all - it's about human intelligence and what truly makes us human."

[Journey to the Unknown?]
"Like Dorothy in Oz, we're on a journey into the unknown. AI might seem like a powerful storm transforming our landscape, but remember - behind every AI system are human creators, human values, and human choices. Once understood, it becomes a tool we can use wisely for the benefit of humanity."

## Q&A
"Now, I'd love to hear your thoughts and questions. What aspects of this AI journey intrigue or concern you most? Let's explore these ideas together."
