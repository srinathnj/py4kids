# Introduction to GenAI: From Past to Future

## Opening

"Hello everyone! Welcome to this journey through the landscape of Generative AI on November 16th, 2024. Like Dorothy's adventure in the Wizard of Oz, we'll experience the gathering storm of AI development, follow our own yellow brick road through current applications, and peek behind the curtain at future possibilities.

## Past Section - The 'Storm Gathering'

[AI > ML > DL > GenAI]
"Think of AI as an evolving family tree. Artificial Intelligence is the grandparent, Machine Learning the parent, Deep Learning the child, and Generative AI our newest family member."

[AI History]
"To understand where we are, let's look at how we got here. The digital revolution has unfolded through key milestones: the Mac in 1984 democratizing computing, the World Wide Web in 1989 connecting us globally, Windows and Linux making software accessible, Google transforming information access, and cloud computing and smartphones changing how we interact with technology. This path led to OpenAI's founding in 2015, the recognition of deep learning pioneers with the 2018 Turing Award, and ultimately, ChatGPT's release in late 2022."

[Turing Test]
"But the fundamental question remains the same as when Alan Turing first posed it: Can machines think? How do we measure machine intelligence?"

[AI Growth & Milestones through ChatGPT]
"The exponential growth in AI capabilities has brought us to a remarkable moment, with ChatGPT marking a turning point in public awareness and interaction with AI."

[How GenAI Works, Training Neural Network, LLM: y = f(x)]
"At its core, GenAI works through sophisticated neural networks, trained on vast amounts of data to recognize and generate patterns. Think of it as teaching a system to understand and create through millions of examples."

[LLM Explainability]
"MIT's Tomaso Poggio helps us understand why these systems work so effectively through three key concepts: Generalization Theory explains their learning capability, Representation Learning shows how they develop internal structures, and Optimization Dynamics reveals why they find good solutions in complex spaces."

## Present Section - "Following the Yellow Brick Road"

[2024 Nobel Prizes through State of AI]
"The scientific impact of AI is being recognized at the highest levels, as we see its influence across every field."

[LLM Model Types through HuggingFace]
"The AI landscape is diverse, with different models optimized for different tasks. While major tech companies lead development, open-source platforms are democratizing access."

[Ollama Platform]
"Platforms like Ollama are making AI accessible to everyone, allowing you to run powerful models locally while maintaining privacy and control."

[Model Benchmarks through Use-Cases]
"As models evolve, their capabilities expand across an increasing range of applications."

[Agent Concept & Systems]
"One of the most exciting developments is AI agents - systems that can plan and execute complex tasks. Platforms like CrewAI, AutoGen, and AgentGPT are making these capabilities accessible to developers."

[AI for Math through SciAgents]
"In scientific domains, AI is becoming a valuable research partner, accelerating discovery and augmenting human capabilities."

[GenAI Examples]
"Let me show you some concrete examples of how these technologies are being applied..."

[Text2SQL Project]
"Here's a practical example from my own work - converting natural language to SQL queries. You can see the demo in action at the linked video."

## Future Section - "Behind the Curtain"

[Geopolitics through Robotics]
"As we peek behind the curtain, we see both opportunities and challenges in the global AI landscape."

[Robot Workers through Privacy]
"The integration of AI with robotics raises important questions about the future of work and privacy."

[AGI through Higher Intelligence]
"As we approach the possibility of Artificial General Intelligence, we must consider what it means for human potential. Could we achieve higher forms of intelligence through this partnership?"

[What Makes Us Human?]
"Perhaps the most important question isn't about artificial intelligence at all - it's about understanding what makes us uniquely human."

[Journey to the Unknown?]
"Like Dorothy in Oz, we're on a journey into the unknown. AI might seem like a powerful storm transforming our landscape, but remember - behind every AI system are human creators, human values, and human choices. Once understood, it becomes a tool we can use wisely for the benefit of humanity."

## Q&A
"I'd love to hear your thoughts and questions. What aspects of this AI journey intrigue or concern you most?"
