## Study Notes

### Concept

#### [Probabilistic Progamming](https://chat.qwen.ai/c/72090629-c170-457c-b834-55da56c16e93)

Agents are AI programs that execute tasks autonomously. They solve problems by running tools, accessing knowledge and memory to improve responses. Unlike traditional programs that follow a predefined execution path, agents dynamically adapt their approach based on context, knowledge and tool results.

Instead of a rigid binary definition, letâ€™s think of Agents in terms of agency and autonomy.

- Level 0: Agents with no tools (basic inference tasks).
- Level 1: Agents with tools for autonomous task execution.
- Level 2: Agents with knowledge, combining memory and reasoning.
- Level 3: Teams of specialized agents collaborating on complex workflows.


### Example Use-Cases

### Performance

Lightning Fast: Agent creation is 10,000x faster than LangGraph, see [performance](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno#performance).

Playground app uses FastAPI, see `~/phidata/libs/agno/agno/playground/playground.py`
