      "The power of AI collaboration has too much to offer.\n",
      "CrewAI is designed to enable AI agents to assume roles, share goals, and operate in a cohesive unit - much like a well-oiled crew. Whether you're building a smart assistant platform, an automated customer service ensemble, or a multi-agent research team, CrewAI provides the backbone for sophisticated multi-agent interactions.\n",

      "1. Installation\n",
      "pip install crewai\n",
      "If you want to install the 'crewai' package along with its optional features that include additional tools for agents, you can do so by using the following command: pip install 'crewai[tools]'.

      "Key Features\n",
      "Role-Based Agent Design: Customize agents with specific roles, goals, and tools.\n",
      "Autonomous Inter-Agent Delegation: Agents can autonomously delegate tasks and inquire amongst themselves, enhancing problem-solving efficiency.\n",
      "Flexible Task Management: Define tasks with customizable tools and assign them to agents dynamically.\n",
      "Processes Driven: Currently only supports sequential task execution and hierarchical processes, but more complex processes like consensual and autonomous are being worked on.\n",
      "Save output as file: Save the output of individual tasks as a file, so you can use it later.\n",
      "Parse output as Pydantic or Json: Parse the output of individual tasks as a Pydantic model or as a Json if you want to.\n",
      "Works with Open Source Models: Run your crew using Open AI or open source models refer to the Connect crewAI to LLMs page for details on configuring your agents' connections to models, even ones running locally!\n",
      "Examples\n",

      "Connecting Your Crew to a Model\n",
      "crewAI supports using various LLMs through a variety of connection options. By default your agents will use the OpenAI API when querying the model. However, there are several other ways to allow your agents to connect to models. For example, you can configure your agents to use a local model via the Ollama tool.\n",
      "Please refer to the Connect crewAI to LLMs page for details on configuring you agents' connections to models.\n",
      "How CrewAI Compares\n",
      "Autogen: While Autogen does good in creating conversational agents capable of working together, it lacks an inherent concept of process. In Autogen, orchestrating agents' interactions requires additional programming, which can become complex and cumbersome as the scale of tasks grows.\n",
      "ChatDev: ChatDev introduced the idea of processes into the realm of AI agents, but its implementation is quite rigid. Customizations in ChatDev are limited and not geared towards production environments, which can hinder scalability and flexibility in real-world applications.\n",
      "CrewAI's Advantage: CrewAI is built with production in mind. It offers the flexibility of Autogen's conversational agents and the structured process approach of ChatDev, but without the rigidity. CrewAI's processes are designed to be dynamic and adaptable, fitting seamlessly into both development and production workflows.\n",
      "Contribution\n",
      "CrewAI is open-source and we welcome contributions. If you're looking to contribute, please:\n",
