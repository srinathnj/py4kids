By comparing these metrics, we gain a comprehensive understanding of a company\'s scale, profitability, market value, and growth potential. Through visualisations, the analysis also explores correlations between these metrics and offers insights into country-level performance, highlighting economic dominance across various sectors. This holistic approach provides a multi-dimensional view of global financial powerhouses, investor confidence, and regional economic trends.\n\nKey Metrics Used:\n1. Revenue (Trailing Twelve Months - TTM):\nTable Name: t_revenue ;\nDefinition: This is the total income generated by a company from its operations in the last twelve months ;\nPotential Insights: High revenue often indicates market dominance or high sales volume. Comparing revenues can reveal which companies are the largest in terms of business volume.\n\n2. Earnings (TTM):\nTable Name: t_earnings\nDefinition: This refers to the company\'s profit after taxes and expenses over the trailing twelve months.\nPotential Insights: Companies with high earnings are more efficient at converting revenue into profit, suggesting better profitability or cost management. A comparison of earnings provides insight into profitability rather than just scale.\n\n3. Market Capitalisation (Market Cap):\nTable Name: t_market_cap\nDefinition: Market cap is the total value of a company\'s outstanding shares of stock, calculated as stock price multiplied by the number of shares. It indicates the company’s size in the stock market.\nPotential Insights: High market cap usually indicates investor confidence in the company. Comparing market cap among the top 15 companies reveals their relative size in financial markets.\n\n4. P/E Ratio (TTM):\nTable Name: t_p_e_ratio\nDefinition: Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio measures a company\'s current share price relative to its per-share earnings.\nPotential Insights: A high P/E ratio may indicate that investors expect high growth in the future, while a low P/E ratio could imply undervaluation or scepticism about growth. Companies are compared by their growth prospects or current valuation.\n\n5. Dividend Yield (TTM):\nTable Name: t_dividend_yield\nDefinition: Dividend yield is a financial ratio that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its share price.\nPotential Insights: High dividend yield may indicate that a company returns more income to shareholders. It’s particularly useful for income-focused investors.\n\n6. Country-Region Map:\nTable Name: t_country_region\nDefinition: This table translate country to region\n\n\n===Response Guidelines \n1. If the provided context is sufficient, please generate a valid SQL query without any explanations for the question. \n2. If the provided context is almost sufficient but requires knowledge of a specific string in a particular column, please generate an intermediate SQL query to find the distinct strings in that column. Prepend the query with a comment saying intermediate_sql \n3. If the provided context is insufficient, please explain why it can\'t be generated. \n4. Please use the most relevant table(s). \n5. If the question has been asked and answered before, please repeat the answer exactly as it was given before. \n6. Ensure that the output SQL is SQLite-compliant and executable, and free of syntax errors. \n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "\n                For this question: which table stores Company P/E Ratio, \n                your generated SQL statement: The LLM is not allowed to see the data in your database.
